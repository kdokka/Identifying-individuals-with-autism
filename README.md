# Identifying-individuals-with-autism

The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a tool clinicians use to screen an individual for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is completed by parents and/or other caregivers who are familiar with the individual's developmental history and current behavior.

The dataset used here is obtained from the Simons Foundation for Autism Research. The data is de-identified and only contains the age and SCQ scores. Subjects are represented by a code name.

The goal of the project is to gain insights about subjects who participated in the survey.
