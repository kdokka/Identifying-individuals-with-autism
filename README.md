# Identifying-individuals-with-autism

The **Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)** is a tool the clinicians use to screen an individual for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is completed by parents and/or other caregivers who are familiar with the individual's developmental history and current behavior.

The dataset used here is obtained from the Simons Foundation for Autism Research. The data (stored in an excel file) is de-identified and does not contain any personally identifying information. It only has **age** and **SCQ scores** of individuals, who are only identified by a code name. No other medical or diagnosis information is provided.

The goal of the project is to explore the dataset and gain insights into the individuals who (or their caregiver/parents) participated in the survey.
